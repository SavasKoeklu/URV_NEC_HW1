Types of data normalisation 

two Types of Data Normalisation
	- Data normalisation
		- Linear transformation: range[0,1],
		- easy normalisation with minimum and maximum of values

	- Data standardisation
	    	-Linear transformation (z-score):
		- the values are substracted with the und divided by the standard deviation

6. Which is better, normalization or standardization?
If your feature (column) contains outliers, normalizing your data will scale most of the data to a small interval, ensuring that all 
components have the same scale but failing to manage outliers adequately. Max-Min Normalization is rarely preferred over standardization since it is less resistant to outliers.
